The Asian elephant is the largest land animal in Asia. It is found in South and Southeast Asia, where it inhabits forests, shrublands and grasslands.

Female Asian elephants live in herds, while adult males tend to be more solitary. The typical lifespan of an Asian elephant is 60-70 years.

The Asian elephant is one of three living animals in the family Elephantidae (the others being the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant).

Unlike African elephants, female Asian elephants lack tusks.

The Asian elephant is endangered due mainly to habitat loss and poaching. Male Asian elephants are targeted for their ivory, while elephants of both sexes are targeted for use in traditional Asian medicine.

          The Asian, or Asiatic golden cat, is a wild cat found in South and Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand and Malaysia. The species is present on the island of Sumatra.

The Asian golden cat is primarily a forest animal, but is also occasionally seen in savannas and grasslands. It is a mid-sized species, around two or three times the size of a domestic cat. As its name suggests, the Asian golden cat has a golden-brown coat. Its face has distinctive light and dark markings.

The golden cat is threatened by deforestation, which is still occurring throughout much of Asia. The species is currently rated “Near Threatened” by the IUCN.
