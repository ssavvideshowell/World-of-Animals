                Antarctica is the earth’s coldest place, with temperatures ranging between −10°C and -60°C. Yet, amidst all adversities, animal life in the Antarctic is unique, with most of the wildlife being extremophiles due to their ability to survive in adverse conditions. One could spot a few terrestrial and most marine and semi-aquatic animals here. Those living on the land are mainly spotted around the coastal areas. The only insect wholly living on the land in Antarctica is the wingless midge, the continent’s largest terrestrial animal.

                <strong>The Antarctic Toothfish</strong>

The Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) is one of two species of genus Dissostichus, the other being the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Both toothfish produce natural antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue that allow them to live in water too cold for other species to inhabit.

          <strong>Penguins</strong>

          No Antarctic animals list would be complete without penguins! Penguins are a family (Spheniscidae) of flightless birds found in the Southern Hemisphere. (Only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is also found in the Northern Hemisphere).

Penguins have small, powerful wings, which they use as flippers, “flying” through the water in pursuit of krill, fish, and other prey.
